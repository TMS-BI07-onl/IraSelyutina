Well done!

For example, 
CREATE TABLE Competition (
	ID INT CONSTRAINT PK_Competition_Id PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY NOT NULL,
	SwimmerID INT NOT NULL,
	LocationID INT NOT NULL,
	JudgeID INT NOT NULL,
	ResultTime TIME NOT NULL,
	StartDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
	EndDate DATETIME
	, CONSTRAINT FK_Competition_To_Swimmer FOREIGN KEY (SwimmerId)  REFERENCES Swimmer (Id),
	CONSTRAINT FK_Competition_To_Location FOREIGN KEY (LocationId)  REFERENCES Locations (Id),
	CONSTRAINT FK_Competition_To_Judge FOREIGN KEY (JudgeId)  REFERENCES Judge (Id)
)
